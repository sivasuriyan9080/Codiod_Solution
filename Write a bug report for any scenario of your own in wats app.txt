Bug Report: unable to Send Voice Messages on WhatsApp

Description:
I am experiencing a bug on WhatsApp where I am unable to send voice messages to any of my contacts. When I try to record a voice message, the recording does not start, or the recording stops abruptly after a few seconds. This bug is occurring consistently and is affecting my ability to communicate with my contacts via WhatsApp.

Steps to Reproduce:

   1. Open WhatsApp and select a contact to send a voice message to.
   2. Press and hold the microphone icon to record a voice message.
   3. Start recording a message by speaking into the microphone.
   4. Observe that the recording does not start or stops abruptly after a few seconds.
   5. Attempt to re-record the message, but the same issue occurs.

Expected Behavior:
When I press and hold the microphone icon to record a voice message, the recording should start immediately and continue until I release the button. The voice message should be recorded in its entirety without any interruptions.

Actual Behavior:
The recording does not start or stops abruptly after a few seconds, which prevents me from recording a complete voice message.

Screenshots:
Unfortunately, screenshots cannot be provided as this issue pertains to audio recording.
